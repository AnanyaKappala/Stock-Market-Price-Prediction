# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
Machine learning project made for Tools and Techniques laboratory (TTLab) in 6th sem of college.

Welcome to the Stock Market Price Prediction repository! This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the stock prices of major tech companies such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN). The goal is to provide accurate forecasts of future stock prices based on historical market data, aiding investors, financial analysts, and traders in making informed decisions.
